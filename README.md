Personal practice while learning javascript

# The Beginning
I am upskilling my language options as I find this very interesting. I will try to use these knowledge to work on small projects and update my [website](https://hamdanbasri.github.io/113/).

Projects:
- None

## Calculator
I created my first calculator based on the following tutorial: [Build this JS calculator in 15 minutes! by Bro Code](https://youtu.be/I5kj-YsmWjM?si=A1lowZwcUqO-Lxkd)
<div align="center">

# The Journey
I am continuing my journey in learning Javascript by following the following tutorial: [JavaScript Tutorial Full Course - Beginner to Pro (2024) by Super Simple Dev](https://youtu.be/EerdGm-ehJQ?si=z_uKh_anDhU-e4eI)

I have created a separate note that will highlight terms that I might find important: [Notes](notes.md).

Progress for each exercise from the tutorial can be found [here](javascriptcourse).

- I reached section 7 of the tutorial which is Functions. I find this tutorial is easy to understand and very well explained.
